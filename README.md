The objective of this report is to conduct a comprehensive market segmentation analysis aimed at identifying actionable customer and operational segments that can help reduce cab cancellations in ride-hailing services. By uncovering patterns in booking behaviour, trip characteristics, and user profiles, this analysis seeks to equip the company with data-driven insights that can inform targeted interventionsâ€”ultimately improving customer satisfaction, enhancing fleet efficiency, and gaining a competitive advantage over established platforms such as Uber and Ola.

This report explores the key segments within the market that are more likely to exhibit high cancellation tendencies, as well as operational contexts where service disruptions are most frequent. These insights form the basis for developing tailored marketing strategies and operational improvements.
